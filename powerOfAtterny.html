                    <h4>Our Lasting Power of Attorney services ensure that your affairs are managed by trusted
                        individuals if you become unable to make decisions yourself.</h4>

                    <h2>Why Make an LPA?</h2>
                    <p>In addition to making a Will, many people choose to put an LPA in place to ensure that their
                        finances, welfare decisions are taken care of if they lose the ability to manage them
                        independently. LPAs are legal documents made under the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>
                    <p>LPA allows you to appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, giving you peace of
                        mind that your affairs will be handled according to your wishes.</p>
                    <p>LPAs are often seen as a safeguard for later in life, but they can also be used immediately, for
                        instance, if you're physically unwell or find it difficult to manage your affairs due to frailty
                        or illness.</p>

                                    <h3>Property and Financial Affairs LPA</h3>
                                    <p>This allows your attorney to manage your finances, including tasks such as paying bills, managing bank accounts, collecting benefits or pensions, and even buying or selling property. This LPA can be used both while you have mental capacity (with your permission) and if you lose capacity.</p>
                                  </li>

                                    <p>This gives your attorney the authority to make decisions about your health and wellbeing, but only if you lose mental capacity. This could include decisions about medical care, daily routines, where you live, and whether to give or refuse consent for life-sustaining treatment.</p>

                    <h3>Choosing Your Attorney</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Choosing the right attorney is an important decision. This should be someone you trust
                            completely, who understands your values, and is capable of making responsible decisions on
                            your behalf. You can appoint one or more attorneys, and specify whether they must act
                            together (jointly), independently or a combination of both for different decisions (jointly
                            and severally).</p>
                        <p>You may also choose to appoint replacement attorneys, individuals who can step in if your
                            original attorney is unable or unwilling to act.</p>
                    </div>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>When Can an Attorney Act?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Your LPA must be signed by you and your chosen attorney(s), certified to confirm you
                            understand the document and are not under pressure, and then registered with the Office of
                            the Public Guardian (OPG) before it can be used. The financial LPA can be used once
                            registered (with your consent if you still have capacity), while the health and welfare LPA
                            can only be used when you can no longer make those decisions yourself.</p>
                    </div>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>Ordinary Power of Attorney</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>We can also advise on <b>Ordinary Powers of Attorney</b>, which give someone temporary
                            authority to manage your financial affairs — for example, while you’re overseas or
                            recovering from illness. These are only valid while you have mental capacity and can be
                            limited to specific tasks or accounts if preferred.</p>
                    </div>
                    <hr />
                    <h3>What Happens if You Don’t Have a Power of Attorney?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>If you lose capacity without an LPA in place, your loved ones will not have the automatic
                            right to manage your affairs. In these situations, they may need to apply to the Court of
                            Protection to be appointed as your deputy, which is a complex and often expensive process
                            that can take several months.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to health or care decisions, professionals may have to act without a clear
                            understanding of your wishes, which can lead to confusion and potential disputes among
                            family members.</p>
                        <p>By creating an LPA, you take control and avoid uncertainty.</p>
                    </div>
